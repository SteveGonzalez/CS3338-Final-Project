# MoonTrek AR

MoonTrek AR is a prototype augmented reality application designed to assist users in exploring the night sky using a telescope. The project focuses on improving accessibility and learning in amateur astronomy by combining telescope viewing with real-time AR overlays.

This repository contains the project structure, documentation, and development materials for the MoonTrek AR concept.


## Project Objective

The main goal of MoonTrek AR is to help users identify celestial objects more easily while using a telescope. Traditional stargazing can be difficult for beginners, especially when it comes to alignment and recognizing constellations. MoonTrek AR aims to simplify this process by displaying visual overlays and helpful information directly through an AR interface.

## Why This Project Is Needed

Many people interested in astronomy struggle with telescope setup, object tracking, and understanding what they are viewing. Existing tools often require separate apps or prior knowledge. MoonTrek AR is intended to reduce this learning curve by providing guidance and educational context in real time, making astronomy more approachable and engaging.

## Features

- Augmented reality overlays that label celestial objects such as the Moon, stars, and constellations
- Visual guidance to assist with telescope alignment and object targeting
- Educational annotations that explain observed celestial bodies
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Real-time synchronization between telescope orientation and AR display


## Development Status

MoonTrek AR is currently a prototype and is not publicly deployed. The project focuses on design, planning, and conceptual implementation rather than a finished consumer application. Features are demonstrated and tested locally during development.

## Accessing the Application

At this stage, the application is not available for public download. The prototype is intended to be run locally during development using an AR-capable device connected to a telescope setup. Future versions may include public deployment or expanded testing access.

## Project Management

Project planning, task assignments, and progress tracking were managed using Jira.
